## 5.4.0

### Features

#### BatchMode (Command line execution)
Added the ability to execute ThunderKit Pipelines using the Unity BatchMode and 
Command line interface
To use this feature you will need to execute the appropriate version of Unity
and supply atleast the `-projectPath`, `-executeMethod` and `-pipeline` 
arguments, and optionally the `-batchmode` and `-manifest` arguments.
Using these command line arguments you can execute ThunderKit Pipelines.

To learn more about Unity's command line arguments refer to 
[Unity Editor command line arguments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditorCommandLineArguments.html)

Arguments:
* `-pipeline=path` - Project Relative Path to target Pipeline 
* `-manifest=path` - Project Relative Path to target Manifest
* `-show-log-window` - Enables displaying the Pipeline Log window during 
  execution

To execute the pipeline you must call the execution method. You can do this 
using the Unity Command line argument -executeMethod and providing 
`ThunderKit.Core.Pipelines.Pipeline.BatchModeExecutePipeline` next.

The following demonstrates a complete setup
```
C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2019.4.26f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode 
-projectpath F:\Projects\Unity\ExampleProject
-manifest="Assets/ThunderKitAssets/BundleManifest.asset"
-pipeline="Assets/ThunderKitAssets/BuildBundles.asset"
-executeMethod ThunderKit.Core.Pipelines.Pipeline.BatchModeExecutePipeline  
```

PackageSourceSetttings to fix data issues caused by this bug

## 5.2.0

### Addressable Browser Type Filtering

Implemented Type filtering in Addressable Browser search with a similar 
implementation to the Project Window.

Users can now enter t:TypeName to filter the addressable list by type. This 
check does a case sensistive contains check on the type full name.  This allows
users to filter not only by type but partial type names and namespaces.

For example, you can filter for all Prefabs by using the filter `t:GameObject`
Another example is that you could filter for all native Unity types by using
`t:UnityEngine`

The type filtering can be used in addition to the normal text match filtering.

The text filtering can now also use Regular Expressions for more complex 
filtering cases.

### Fixes

* Fix Null Reference Exception caused by Package source refreshing
* Fix Unity crash caused by heavy repeated calls to AssetDatabase.FindAssets
* Fix initialization error in Addressable Browser due to an incorrect type 
  lookup
* Fix some cases where addressables becomes unloaded and does not reload.
  Some cases for this issue still exist and some cases are game specific and
  may require custom import extensions to resolve.
* Fix an issue where the Import process would loop indefinitely when the 
  version of the game's Unity engine and the current Unity Editor version do
  not match.

### Community Contributions

synchronously

## 5.0.1
* Fix compatibility issue with Unity 2019+

## 5.0.0

### A Note about Installing ThunderKit

ThunderKit installation directions have generally had users install ThunderKit
using it's master branch, which is provided with the url 
`https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit.git`

This was a poor precedent to set and can lead to unexpected upgrades for users.
Going forward it is recommended to install ThunderKit using a Tagged release.

For Example installing ThunderKit 5.0.0 can be done using the following url:
`https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit.git#5.0.0`

When a project needs to be migrated to a different version of ThunderKit the 
ProjectRoot/Packages/manifest.json can be edited to change the value of the url
used to install ThunderKit.  After returning to Unity the Unity Package Manager
will detect the change and update the ThunderKit installation to the correct 
version.

### Import Rework and ImportExtensions

The process for importing games has been completely reworked into a modular
extensible system.

Now every default import step can be enabled or disabled allowing for the
implementation of custom import processes and importers designed for different
environments.

ThunderKit now loads and creates concrete types derived from ImportExtension
out of assemblies decorated with the ImportExtensionsAttribute and adds them
to the new ImportConfiguration ThunderKitSetting.

Using these features customized import steps can be developed for games,
minimizing the time starting development on new projects.

### Assembly Import Changes

The Assembly Import process has been improved with the ability to use multiple
different identity algorithms when producing assembly meta files for unity.
These identities are how Unity identifies the assembly to load MonoBehavior
and ScriptableObject Types from.

There are currently three algorithms available for producings the identities:
1. Original - This is the algorithm ThunderKit has used to since it was 
   released.
2. Stabilized - This is the same as Original, except it ensures that UTF8 
   encoding is used to generate and write the GUID.
3. AssetRipper Compatible = This is the algorithm used by AssetRippers new
   Assembly Export mode and provides the ability to interoperate with 
   AssetRipper rips and ThunderKit projects. This would allow you to copy
   a prefab from a rip into a mod project for example and have all the
   scripts be correctly loaded.

### Pipeline Quick Access Toolbar

A Pipeline Toolbar has been added to the Unity Main toolbar allowing you to
quickly select a pipeline and manifest to execute without having to search
your Project.

To add Pipelines and Manifests to your toolbar as options, select the Pipeline
or Manifest in your project and check the "Quick Access" checkbox in the 
header. This will allow you to click the appropriate selector in the toolbar
and run it using the Execute button, or view the most recent log using the Log
button.

### Addressable Support 

#### Importing

Support Addressables has been added to ThunderKit. With the new 
ImportAddressableCatalog ImportExtension you can import the catalog from a game
using addressables, enabling you to load addressaable assets in the editor.

#### Edit and Runtime usage 

This allows developers to setup simple tools to apply materials or instantiate 
prefabs
in the editor for viewing. Scripts created to do this can be setup to work both
in the editor or at runtime. See the 
[Simply Address](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/SimplyAddress)
repository for an implementation of such features.

#### Addressable Browser

The [Addressable Browser](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/AddressableBrowser) 
provides an interface to search and explore a games Addressable Catalog.
Using this browser you can locate the assets and their addresses so that you
can use a games assets in the editor and at runtime.

The Addressable Browser allows you to search for assets based upon their 
address, name, and type.  Additional filters may come in the future.

#### Limitations

Editing Addressable Assets is limited to a code based approach and tooling
to resolve this is outside of the scope of ThunderKit. Look projects like
[Simply Address](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/SimplyAddress) that provide
generic tools for working with addressables in a modding context.

Addressable assets can't be referenced like traditional Unity assets. This
limits using addressable assets to a code based approach. However, generic 
tools
like SimplyAddress are being and can be developed to improve the ease of use.

### Documentation 

[Documentation](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Documentation) has been updated
to be extensible via the DocumentationRoot ScriptableObject. Creating a 
DocumentationRoot can be done via the Project Window Context menu under the
ThunderKit sub menu. A DocumentationRoot establishes a root documentation
section in the ThunderKit documentation window with the same name. 

Additionally, DocumentationRoot contains the Main Page member, which can 
be set to any Markdown file regardless of its location as the page displayed
when the DocumentationRoot is selected.

Documentation is now easier to write and extend, no longer requiring the 
creation of UXML and USS files to setup simple documentation collections.
See the
[ThunderKitDocumentation](assetlink://GUID/33d96cac9b15cba468162cf9d18ec0f3)
for an example of a working documentation collection.

Documentation has been added and the layout of the existing documentation 
has been re-organized.

Tutorials is a new and growing collection of documents that will walk you 
through getting started with usaging and extending ThunderKit. Submission 
of markdown files to grow this collection of tutorials is very welcome and 
can be submitted on discord or through a pull request on github.

### Binary Patcher BsDiff

The Binary Patcher BsDiff has been added to ThunderKit to enable import
workflows
that require modifications to game binaries for scenarios that need them such
as editor compatibility.

The ApplyPatch and CreatePatch PipelineJobs have been created to enable 
Pipeline
workflows that can utilize binary patching.

### AssetsTools.NET

A modified version of AssetsTools.NET has been included to enable importing
of project settings from games.  This is provided via the ImportProjectSettings
ImportExtension. Configure it on the Import Configuration 
[ThunderKit Settings](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings) page.

Additionally, game version checking has also been enhanced using
AssetsTools.NET

### Community Contributions

#### Edit Source / Select Source

[Documentation](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Documentation) pages now have a 
context menu allowing the users to select the source markdown files or edit 
them in their preferred editor, configurable from 
[ThunderKit Settings](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings)

#### Guid Stabilized links for Markdown

AssetLink and Documentation schemes for ThunderKit Markdown have been enhanced 
to allow referencing assets using their GUID. This feature enables 
documentation to remain stable even when moving files around inside the unity 
environment, or externally when the user takes care to move their associated 
meta file with them.

All Documenation has been updated to use the new GUID format for referencing
project assets, this will help ensure that documentation links remain stable
reducing maintenance cost in the future.

#### Cross Documentation Page Links

Documentation has been updated with links between documentation pages to 
improve ease of use.

 * Thanks to nebby1999 for these features

#### FlowPipeline Whitelist / Blacklist

FlowPipelines have been updated with Whitelist / Blacklist system with 
automatic updating for old asset files. This affects the Copy, Zip, and Delete 
PipelineJobs which have the ability to exclude Manifests from their run. Now 
alternatively a whitelist can be provided which causes the job to only run on 
manifests in that list.

Users should not need to update their pipelines, but upgrading to ThunderKit 5 
will make changes that are not backwards compatible to your pipeline assets.

* Thanks to KingEnderbrine for this feature

### Fixes and improvements

#### General
* Fix error in FileUtil which produced incorrect FileIds for Script references
  to Assemblies
* Make minor improvements for enhancing cross platform editor compatibility
* Stop persisting PackageGroups and PackageVersions to disk to avoid runaway 
  disk usage
* Fix a number of small memory leaks
* Add doc comments to code base (plenty more work to be done here)
* Create UXML and USS folders in ThunderKit root and move all UXML and USS too 
  them some template specific USS remains in the UXML folders next to their 
  related UXML files
* Updated ThirdPartyNotices.md

#### Markdown

* Added JsonFrontMatter for Page Headers 
  - Json FrontMatter can be used to collect a limited set of values from a
    Markdown file. See the 
    [FrontMatter Struct](assetlink://GUID/70db1552b66c4e34d88f6b33d3e0ead7) for
    details.
* Generic Attributes - Apply USS/CSS Classes to Blocks of text in markdown
* Improvements to the markdown style have been made to bring it more in line 
  with common markdown styling
* MarkdownElement now detects changes to source files and updates automatically

#### Import
* Fixed import process sometimes not completing requiring the user to change 
  focus away from and back to the editor to complete.

#### PipelineLogs
* Add setting to enable the PipelineLog window to show automatically when
  a pipeline is executed.
* Automatically update PipelineLog window when visible and a pipeline is
  executed
* Updated PipelineLog window to show a button for entries with Log Context

#### ComposableObjects
* Fix an issue with the ComposableObjectEditor which caused it to be more 
  computationally intensive than necessary
* Enance ComposableObjectEditor to allow it to render elements with Missing 
  Scripts to inform the user
  * This currently doesn't allow elements with missing scripts to be deleted
* Improved the ComposableElement Edit Script context menu item to be more 
  reliable


## 4.1.1

### Pipelines and Logging

This update introduces a system to maintain logs of Pipeline runs. These logs
saved under the Assets/ThunderKitAssets/Logs folder and grouped by Pipeline.
Pipeline Logs are rich data sets which provides listings of runtime function
and reporting of build artifacts. Logs will show you what was done during a
pipeline run, what files were copied, deleted, and created during that run.

The pipeline logs will additionally show any errors, and provide any 
potentially relevant data from the errors that could lead to resolution. These 
errors are enhanced by ThunderKit's markdown system, allowing you to click on 
source code lines to open up your code editor to the source of errors for 
further debugging. This should help developers who extend ThunderKit with 
custom PipelineJobs and PathComponents.

The most recent log for a pipeline can be launched by inspecting the Pipeline 
then clicking on the Show Log button.

The execute button for pipelines have been moved from under the 
"Add Pipeline Button" to the top left of the Pipeline Inspector. This should 
reduce incidents of accidentally firing off the Pipeline.

### Markdown Level Up

Text alignment and kerning has been improved significantly.  I'm sorry for any 
mental anguish users have suffered.

The Markdown implementation performance and output quality has been 
significantly improved. Previously the UIElementsRenderer would break all 
string literals on whitespace separation and then render each word as an 
individual VisualElement of type Label. This provided an easy way to achieve 
flow document layouting, however resulted in large documents taking an 
exceptionally long time to render.

In this update the UIElementsRenderer will now scan each ParagraphBlock 
returned by MarkDig and if the Paragraph contains only simple string literals 
will opt to render the entire paragraph in a single Label.  This reduces the 
number of elements generated in large documents by thousands. This results in 
significantly improved render times in large documents as well as faster 
layouting.

Additionally, the Markdown system now supports adding custom Schemes for 
Markdown links from external libraries which has enabled new features in 
ThunderKit.

Finally the code design of the MarkdownElement and its utilization has been 
improved to prevent cases where Markdown doesn't have the necessary visual 
styles to render correctly.

### Documentation Improvements

The Markdown improvements has allowed the introduction of Documentation page 
links to be created. Now MarkdownElements can link to specific documentation 
pages.  This hasn't been applied to all documentation to create a highly 
connected document graph yet, but additional enhancements to documentation will
be done over time.

Some documents have been reformatted to improve their layout flexibility

### Fixes and Improvements

* Automatically generate a PackageSource for the ThunderKit Extensions 
  Thunderstore

* Remove ThunderKit.Core.Editor namespace due to code clarity issues a 
  namespace named Editor creates in Unity

* Fix bugs with Pipeline flow related to Asynchronous migration

* Fix a number of cases where Exception context could be hidden

* Add a new toggle to Copy jobs that indicates if the Job should try to create 
  the target directory, default value is true

* Fixed some cases where Pipelines would run to the end instead of halting when
  encountering what should have been a fatal exception

* StageAssetBundles and StageAssemblies logging and code flow has been improved 
  to clarify common cases where these jobs will fail to execute correct

* Added and improved logging to Copy, Delete, ExecutePipepline, ExecuteProcess, 
  StageAssemblies, StageAssetBundles, StageDependencies, StageManifestFiles, 
  Zip and StageThunderstoreManifest

* Fix issue where SteamBepInExLaunch could fail to start due to formatting of
  command line args

* Fix issue in Zip that could cause the job to fail in a case it shouldn't


## 4.0.0

### Important

This update is breaking support for .NET 3.5 due to the difficulty in providing 
functional tools for certain aspects of Unity which are asynchronous. For 
people who need .NET 3.5 support, install ThunderKit using the 
`net35compatibility` branch which will receive fixes able to be ported upon 
request

```
"com.passivepicasso.thunderkit":"https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit.git#net35compatibility",
``` 

This update changes how Manifest assets in the Unity AssetDatabase are managed. 
You will be asked to run an upgrade process that will update all your Manifests 
to the new configuration automatically. Please make sure you back up your 
projects before updating in case of any problems.

Some games do not have their Unity game version properly identified in their 
executable. Due to this, ThunderKit will now read the games globalgamemanager 
file to identify the correct Unity version for the game.  Some users may find 
they need to switch unity versions because of this change, but it is a 
necessary step to take to avoid unforseen issues.

### Known Issues

* Unity 2021.2.0b7 does not detect package installation or uninstallation 
automatically requiring the user to manually refresh the Project. This is an 
issue which appears to be a bug with Unity's AssetDatabase.Refresh call and a 
bug report will be generated for Unity Technologies to investigate. This bug 
may be resolved in newer versions of the Unity 2021.2 beta, however there are 
no games available to test against which wouldn't introduce factors that could 
muddle results. If Unity doesn't appear to import packages installed from 
Thunderstore, or doesn't appear to fully remove an uninstalled package, refresh
your project using the context menu option in the Project window, or on windows 
press Ctrl+R

* Unity 2021.2.0b7 locks up when importing and loading assemblies from packages
  or games.
  - Work-around: Kill the Unity process after it seems like the import process 
    has stopped loading new assemblies and restart Unity

### Improvements

* Unity 2021.2 beta can now succesfully install packages, however the user must
  manually refresh the project (Ctrl+R) to complete the installation.

* Pipelines and PipelineJobs now execute asynchronously to support operations 
  which require that Unity take control of processing.

* StageAssemblies previously relied on simply copying assemblies from the 
  project's Library/ScriptAssemblies folder. While fast and convenient this
  prevented users from taking control of build parameters which may be 
  necessary for their projects. StageAssemblies now allows you to specify Build
  Targets and Build Target Groups in addition to allowing you to stage debug
  databases. Due to this change StageAssemblies now builds player assemblies,
  allowing the utilization of available optimization steps the compilation
  engine provides.

* Package Installation has been improved to no longer utilize the AssetDatabase 
  to create and place files to avoid edge cases with some versions of Unity
  that prevent installation. Due to this change Manifest's now have Asset GUIDs 
  assigned by ThunderKit. This change ensures that Manifest's will easily and 
  automatically reference their dependencies, and references to dependencies 
  will continue to work after reinstallation them. This change is not backwards 
  compatible

* Added compiler directives and code to support Unity 2021.2

* Add a utility to assist in migrating Non-ThunderKit modding projects to 
  ThunderKit by updating asset references from Dll references to Script file
  references. This is available under Tools/ThunderKit/Migration 

* Added error messaging for PathReferences and Manifests

### Fixes and Changes

* Fix cases where Progress bars may not update or close as expected
* Fix ManifestIdentities not always being saved during package installation
* Fix issue where somtimes PackageSourceSettings will empty its reference array
  requiring manual repopulation
* Fix PackageManager not removing Scripting Defines when removing a ThunderKit
  managed Package

## 3.4.1

### Fixes

* Fix an issue where scanning some assemblies would result in a 
  ReflectionTypeLoadException preventing the settings window from loading.

## 3.4.0

### PackageSource Management

PackageSources have been updated with central management and the ability to 
setup multiple sources of the same types.

You can now manage your Package Sources in the 
[ThunderKit Settings Window](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings).
In the ThunderKit Settings window you will be able to Add, Remove, Configure,
Rename and Refresh your PackageSources.

### ThunderKit Extensions Thunderstore

With the ability to add multiple PackageSources to your project, you can now 
add the ThunderKit Extensions Thunderstore as a source. Like all Thunderstores,
this provides the ability for the community to add resources that help grow the
platform in a modular way.

If you would like to take advantage of the ThunderKit Extensions Thunderstore,
Add a new ThunderstoreSource to your PackageSources and set the url to
``` https://thunderkit.thunderstore.io ```


## 3.3.0

### Steam Launch support

Some Unity games require that Steam launches them in order to successfully 
start up, to support this requirement the previous update added the 
RegistryLookup PathComponent. This update builds upon that by adding a 
Steam.exe PathReference asset which locates the Steam.exe using the Windows 
Registry via the RegistryLookup PathComponent.

To improve the coverage and usability of the BepInEx Template, the template now
includes a SteamBepInExLaunch Pipeline and the Launch Pipeline was renamed to 
BepInExLaunch

In Order to use the SteamBepInExLaunch Pipeline, copy it over the BepInExLaunch 
pipeline in your Build and Launch Pipeline, or replace BepInExLaunch anywhere 
you used it with the SteamBepInExLaunch pipeline.

References to the Launch Pipeline will be automatically updated to 
BepInExLaunch.

### Templates

Two new Templates have been added to ThunderKit under 
`ThunderKit/Editor/Templates`
DirectLaunch is a new pre-configured Launch pipeline which directly executes
the game's Executable in its working directory. SteamLaunch is a new 
pre-configured launch pipeline which executes the game's Executable in its 
working directory using Steam and the applaunch command line argument.

### GameAppId and Steam Launching

In order to use any of the pre-configured Steam launching pipelines you will 
need to provide ThunderKit with the games Steam App Id.

Follow these Steps to setup Steam Launching
1. Create a new PathReference under your Assets directory and name it GameAppId
2. Add the Constant PathComponent to the newly created PathReference
3. Find the Steam App Id for the game you're modding
  * You can find the SteamAppId easily by copying it from the game's Steam 
    Store page url

After Completing these steups you're seting to use Steam Launching.

### Fixes and Improvements

* Recently a ManifestIdentity data loss issue was re-discovered, this has not
  yet been resolved but some pieces of code have been updated in response while
  a proper resolution is pending
* Some PipelineJobs and PathComponents referenced a Manifests's 
  ManifestIdentity by using LINQ to query for it in the Manifest's Data 
  elements, these have been updated to use the Manifest's cached Identity
  reference.
* StageThunderstoreManifest has been updated to provide a clearer error 
when a dependency is missing its ManifestIdentity
* Some minor code cleanup was done against commented out code and unnecessary
  usings
* Fixed LocalThunderstoreSource not updating its listing when it already has 
  Packages listed
* Fixed PackageSource.Clear Failing to clear Packages successfully under some
  conditions
* Fixed PackageManager failing to render correctly when a Package has invalid 
  dependency information



## 3.2.0

### New Feature: PathComponent: Registry Lookup

the Registry Lookup path component has been added to support cases where values
from the registry are needed to complete Pipeline efforts. For example, some 
games require steam to execute them, and you may need to do so using the Steam 
executable. The installed Steam executable can easily be located by looking up 
the value in the registry, and this provides a path to that.

### Performance Improvements

* ThunderstoreAPI has been updated to utilize gzip compression in order to 
  greatly increase the speed of acquiring package listings.
* Fixed MarkdownRenderer's LinkInlineRenderer leaking handles and memory
* Fix an issue with SettingsWindowData and ThunderstoreSettings that would cause
  the settings window to have poor responsiveness

### Bugs

* Fix a pageEntry.depth to be pageEntry.Depth in Documentation.cs for Unity 
  2019+
* Fix a NullReferenceException that could show up on the Settings window 
  sometimes
* Fix cases in PackageManager that could cause a null reference and fail to 
  load the manager UI
* Fix a problem that would cause a PackageSource to have no packages and be 
  unable to be populated

## 3.1.7

### Fixes and Improvements

* Improve the Package Manager search responsiveness

## 3.1.6

### Fixes and Improvements

* Improve package import process with better ProgressBar status messages
* Install packages as final step of import process

## 3.1.1

This update implements support for .NET 3.5 and includes a number of general 
improvements and fixes

### Optimization

Special thanks to Therzok for doing an optimization pass to clean up a number 
of cases where the code could be more efficient and cleaner.

### Package Manager
* Now updates when package sources are refreshed.
* Now refreshes package sources when opened.
* Now has a Refresh button next to the Filters button which will refresh all 
  available PackageSources
* PackageSources now invoke the SourcesInitialized event when a source has been
  updated
* PackageSources can register an event handler on the InitializeSources event 
  to be informed when it should update
* Thunderstore API no longer automatically updates on a timer

### 3.5 Migration changes

* Added csc.rsp and mcs.rsp to AssemblyDefinition containing folders to ensure 
  that the correct language version is used for ThunderKit regardless of 
  Scripting Back End choice.
* Removed Async/Await as its not available in 3.5
  * Some cases were replaced with other asynchronous mechanisms.
  * More cases will be moved to asynchronous mechanisms in the future, however 
    there are currently a few that were migrated to synchronous execution.
* Migrate to Directory.GetFiles and Directory.GetDirectories over 
  Directory.EnumerateFiles and Directory.EnumerateDirectories due to lack of 
  support in .NET 3.5


### Zip Changes

* Migrated to SharpCompress from System.IO.Compression
* Updated zip handling in ThunderstoreSource and LocalThunderstoreSource
* Updated Zip PipelineJob to use SharpCompress

### Markdown / Documentation changes
* Improved method of locating Documentation assets
* Significant improvements made to the UIElementRenderer allocations
* Improvements to Regex Usage

### File System changes
* Migrated many file system management facilities to use FileUtil instead of
  System.IO types
* Updated Copy PipelineJob to use FileUtil  This changes how Copy works, A 
  recursive copy will Replace the designated destination directory, not fill 
  its contents
* Stage Manifest Files now uses FileUtil to deploy files

### BepInEx Template Changes

The BepInEx template has been updated to use some new features that arose out 
of the .NET 3.5 changes. First, the template is somewhat large so it has been 
broken up into 4 Pipelines
1. Stage:  This pipeline executes StageAssetBundles, StageAssemblies, 
   StageDependencies, StageManifestFiles and finally StageThunderstoreManifest.
2. Deploy: Conducts the following Copy jobs
    1. Copy BepInEx to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack
    2. Copy plugins to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/plugins
    3. Copy patchers to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/patchers
    4. Copy monomods to ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/monomod
    5. Copy winhttp.dll to the Games root directory
    6. Copy a BepInEx config targeted by the PathReference named BepInExConfig 
       if it is defined in the project to 
       ProjectRoot/ThunderKit/BepInExPack/BepInEx/config
3. Launch:  Executes the games executable with the necessary command line 
   parameters to load BepInEx
4. Rebuild and Launch:  Executes the 3 prior Pipelines in order.

To get started on a new mod project you only need to copy the 
`Rebuild and Launch` pipeline into your Assets folder and then populate the 
Manifest field.

## 3.0.0 

### Initial Setup
A Welcome window has been added to ThunderKit to help users set up their

### ThunderKit Installer - Removed
The ThunderKit installer has been removed.  The installer caused many 
development issues and lost work during the development of ThunderKit. While 
this issue may not have affected end users, the risk associated with the cost 
of lost work makes this feature dangerous to continue to maintain.

Unity 2018.1-2019.2 users will need to add the Thunderkit dependency to their 
projects Packages/manifest.json

For Unity 2019.3+ users can add ThunderKit using the Git url and use the 
[Install from Git](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)
option in the Unity Package Manager.

### ThunderKit Settings

ThunderKit Settings now get a dedicated window from ThunderKit and can be 
accessed from the main menu under 
[Tools/ThunderKit/Settings](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings). These 
settings will no longer show up in the Project Settings window.

### Debugging Features

ComposableObjects now support some debugging features to provide an easy access
interface to implementations of Composable Object to report errors in the UI.

ComposableElements now have 2 members, IsErrored and ErrorMessage. The 
ComposableObjectEditor will change the header color of ComposableElements to 
red if IsErrored is true, signalling where a problem may be.

Implementations of ComposableObject are responsible for setting the values in 
IsErrored and ErrorMessage.  

For examples see [Pipeline](assetlink://Packages/com.passivepicasso.thunderkit/Editor/Core/Pipelines/Pipeline.cs) 
and [PathReference](assetlink://Packages/com.passivepicasso.thunderkit/Editor/Core/Paths/PathReference.cs)

If a pipeline encounters a problem it will halt its execution and highlight the
step that it faulted on. The PipelineJobs and Pipeline itself are setup to log 
exceptions to the Unity console like normal, with these two pieces of 
information you should be able to quickly identify and rectify problems.

ThunderKit Manifests do not utilize these debugging features as they are only 
Data Containers, however if worth while usage for debugging issues can be 
identified then support will be added.

### Dependencies

Dependency Management in the 3.0.0 update has changed significantly.  Instead 
of Manifests installing and managing dependencies in its entirety, Manifests 
will now only be responsible for containing dependency references.  

Instead a user will now install packages via the 
[Package Manager](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Packages), and then 
add the Manifest from the Packages folder to the Manifest that requires the 
dependency

### Package Manager

ThunderKit now includes a complete Package Manager, available from the main 
menu under [Tools/ThunderKit/Packages](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Packages)

The ThunderKit Package Manager is how you will add and remove all mod 
dependencies for your project.
If a mod in your project needs to depend on a Mod, Loader, or Library, you have
the ability to install these dependencies through the Package Manager.

Currently the Package Manager comes with support for Thunderstore by default, 
select your Thunderstore community by setting the url from the 
[ThunderKit Settings](menulink://Tools/ThunderKit/Settings).

You can also create a Local Thunderstore source where you can specify a folder 
to examine for zip files. Zip files in Local Thunderstore Sources must conform 
to Thunderstore's file naming schemes in order to be resolved correctly. 

This scheme is: `Author-ModName-Version.zip`

### Documentation
Documentation is a major issue for new users and as such ThunderKit now comes 
with integrated documentation to help onboard new users. The documentation 
available from the main menu under Tools/ThunderKit/Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress and improvements will be made as a better 
understanding is gained about users needs for information.
